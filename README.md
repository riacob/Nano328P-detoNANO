Refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/riacob/Nano328P-detoNANO/wiki) for more information.

# Hardware
![First Basic Kit Build](/docs/basic_model_kit_1.jpg "First Basic Kit Build")
First build of the "Basic" Kit
<br>
Note: the key switch has been bypassed by a jumper link, since this model will be powered exclusively from the Arduino's USB port.
<br>
The safety layer the key was meant to add is replaced by the ability to unplug the external power, which is impossible in the enclosed "Pro" and "Ultimate" models.
<br>
The devices, as stated in the documentation, can be PIN-protected either way, thus ensuring safety of operation.
